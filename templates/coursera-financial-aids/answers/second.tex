\section{Example}
\subsection{\textit{Attention Models course - Deep Learning specialization}, December 2022}
Nowadays Attention Models are thought of as the state-of-the-art method in the field of Natural Language Processing. Since it represents the state of the art in this industry, having it as a professional ability will be beneficial for me in my job. By creating NLP applications that execute question-and-answer text, tools to translate languages and summarize text, and ultimately a chatbot, I will be able to better comprehend the concepts of the attention model after completing this course. 

Additionally, I want to pursue my academic goals further by first earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing. Reaching my goal will be made easier by my understanding of attention models. By obtaining financial aid from Coursera, I will be motivated to continue my chosen route in education. I will also make sure to complete the course and all the assignments by the deadline. 

\subsection{\textit{Linear Algebra course - Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization},  2023}
Mathematics applications are everywhere: in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, .. and most related to me, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. It is important for a Computer Scientist to have a decent knowledge of math, especially Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics. Digging deeper into the mathematical base of Artificial Intelligence would be beneficial for me in my job. By representing data as vectors and matrices and identifying their properties using concepts of singularity, rank, linear independence, etc; applying common vector and matrix algebra operations like the dot product, inverse, and determinants; expressing certain types of matrix operations as linear transformations and finally apply concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to machine learning problems, I will be able to better comprehend the concepts of Linear Algebra and its application to Data Science after this course.

Additionally, I want to pursue my academic goals further by first earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing. Reaching my goal will be made easier by my understanding of Linear Algebra and its application in Data Science. By obtaining financial aid from Coursera, I will be motivated to continue my chosen route in education. I will also make sure to complete the course and all the assignments by the deadline.
