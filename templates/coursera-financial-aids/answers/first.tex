\section{Reason you applied for aid}

\subsection{December 2022 version}
My name is [YOUR NAME?], and I am a senior studying Computer Science in Vietnam, majoring in Natural Language Processing [MENTIONED IN THE COURSE] There are few people who are passionate enough to consider Natural Language Processing [whatever lol] as a career in our country. Since the University does not offer sufficient knowledge about this field, I must take external classes to gain more experience, and Coursera is a suitable place to do that. 

I completed my Natural Language Processing specialization earlier this year. The course has dramatically helped me understand how Deep Learning works and how it can be applied to various Natural Language Processing tasks. Now I want to gain more skills with Deep Learning, so I am taking this course. 

Due to my status as a student, I cannot afford many external courses. I am still dependent on my family's financial support while taking some other part-time jobs to pay my bills and rent. This financial aid will assist me with my current studies and financial situation.

\subsection{Updated version for \textit{Mathematics for Machine Learning} course, 2023}

My name is [YOUR NAME?], and I am a senior studying Computer Science in Vietnam, majoring in Deep Learning (specifically Natural Language Processing). During my first years as a freshman, mathematics was a sophisticated topic for me. Later when I run into Deep Learning, I realised my mathematics skills are not eligible and therefore I must take further mathematics courses.

I completed several Specializations on Coursera, including Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and GANs. These course were excellent, not just by its content and practical excercises but their awesome instructors, who guided me through its process
