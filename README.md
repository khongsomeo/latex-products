# LaTeX templates for further use

$\LaTeX$ templates and archived templates, by @khongsomeo since 2019.

## Notes
- Some templates used BibTeX or BibLaTeX for bibliography rendering, depends on some fuzzy heuristics which we didn't remember how and why we pick it (lol). This means if your compilation results in BibTex/BibLaTeX error, try changing it to other Bib engines before considering it an error.
- These templates would work (best) in TexStudio or Overleaf. However, `textlive` does **not** install full LaTeX packages. In order to render some packages (e.g. `algorithm`) offline, you **must** install the `texlive-full` package (which is around 5GB!). Therefore we'd recommend you using Overleaf for the best experience.
